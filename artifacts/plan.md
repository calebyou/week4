# Plan for Web Page Implementation

## Overview

The web page is a modern, visually appealing landing page for a service called "jive." The layout is clean and minimalistic, with a focus on user engagement and clear calls to action. Here's a breakdown of the main sections:

1. **Header:**
   - Logo on the left.
   - Navigation links ("Login" and "Sign up") on the right.

2. **Hero Section:**
   - Centralized bold text with a catchy headline.
   - Subheading text providing more context.
   - A prominent "Sign up free" button.

3. **Visual Section:**
   - Two overlapping smartphone images displaying a QR code and a messaging interface.
   - Decorative abstract shapes in the background.

4. **How It Works Section:**
   - Three-step process with icons and descriptions.
   - "Start Jiving" button centered below the steps.

5. **Footer:**
   - Logo and tagline.
   - Links to "About," "Privacy," "Terms," and "Contact."

### Layout Considerations

- **Flexbox vs. Grid:** 
  - Flexbox is recommended for the header and footer for easy alignment of items.
  - CSS Grid can be used for the "How It Works" section to align the three steps evenly.

  - Media queries should be used to ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes, especially for the overlapping smartphone images.
